## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Great project to practice CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I'm looking to improve my skills on HTML5 and CSS3 even further, more likely on Flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

Most of what I learned, I learned from these 3 resources:

- [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) - Perfect place to learn a lot about web development in general, extremely recommended.
- [Kevin Powell Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - The king of CSS, he has really useful videos and courses about HTML and CSS.
- [Web Dev Simplified Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified/videos) - Great Youtube Channel to learn about web development.
